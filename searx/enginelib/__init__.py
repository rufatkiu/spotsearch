"""Engine related implementations

.. note::

   The long term goal is to modularize all relevant implementations to the
   engines here in this Python package.  In addition to improved modularization,
   this will also be necessary in part because the probability of circular
   imports will increase due to the increased typification of implementations in
   the future.

   ToDo:

   - move :py:obj:`searx.engines.load_engine` to a new module `searx.enginelib`.
